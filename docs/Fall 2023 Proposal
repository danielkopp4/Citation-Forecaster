# Vision

Citation Forecaster is a project designed to analyze academic publications to predict the number of citations a publication receives after a given amount of time. This project utilizes a novel dataset derived from combining the arxiv dataset and the citation count from the crossref API. This tool is ideal for researchers who wish to understand the potential impact of their work, organizations interested in analyzing research trends, or anyone involved in academic publishing.

Our Citation Prediction Engine aims to empower researchers, educators, and institutions with foresight, enabling them to make informed decisions, identify emerging trends, and foster academic excellence. We envision a future where this engine becomes an indispensable tool, driving progress and innovation in the world of academic citations.

# Goals

- Analyze academic publications to predict citation counts
- Use the prediction engine to create an SEO tool to optimize academic abstracts and title
- Produce a publication describing the creation and use of the novel dataset

# Milestones

## September:

- Assemble a team and assign roles
- Set up local setups following repository guidelines
- Familiarize the team with the repository issue list and self-assignment process

## October:

- Finalize Dataset
- Fine-tune model to predict citations with greater accuracy
- Begin analysis of academic publications

## November:

- Test citation prediction function
- Draft and revise publication on dataset creation and use
- Finalize Model

## December:

- Finalize publication on dataset creation and use
- Create a tool to optimize the title and abstract 
- Publish a Paper examining the findings of the analysis and dataset
